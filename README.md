# 💰 Expense Tracker — Django Web Application

A full-stack personal finance web app built with Django, where users can register, log in, and
track their income and expenses with a modern dashboard, interactive Chart.js visualizations,
monthly reports, and CSV export.

---

## 📖 Project Overview

Expense Tracker is a portfolio-ready, production-structured Django application that demonstrates
authentication, per-user data isolation, class-based views, Django ORM aggregation, and a
responsive Bootstrap 5 UI. Every user only ever sees their own transactions — categories are
shared, but income/expense records are scoped to the logged-in user at the queryset level.

---

## ✨ Features

### Authentication
- User registration, login, logout
- "Remember Me" login option (extends session to 2 weeks)
- Editable profile page (name, email, phone, bio, monthly budget)
- Change password flow

### Transactions
- Add / Edit / Delete / View income & expense transactions
- Server-side validation (positive amounts only, category must match transaction type)
- AJAX delete confirmation modal on the transaction list
- Pagination (10 per page)

### Filters & Search
- Filter by category, transaction type, month, and date range
- Free-text search across description and category name

### Dashboard
- Summary cards: Total Income, Total Expense, Current Balance, Number of Transactions
- Recent transactions table
- 4 live Chart.js charts:
  - Pie — Expense by Category
  - Doughnut — Income vs Expense
  - Bar — Monthly Income vs Monthly Expense
  - Line — Expense Trend (last 6 months)

### Reports & Analytics
- Monthly report with income, expense, savings, and transaction count
- Category breakdown table for the selected month
- Export the monthly report to CSV
- Built entirely on Django ORM aggregation (`Sum`, `Count`, `Annotate`, `Aggregate`, `TruncMonth`)

### Admin Panel
- Custom `ModelAdmin` for Category, Transaction, and Profile
- List filters, search fields, date hierarchy, and autocomplete on Transaction

### UI / UX
- Responsive Bootstrap 5 layout with a collapsible sidebar (mobile-friendly)
- Bootstrap Icons throughout
- Dark mode toggle (persisted via cookie)
- Card hover effects and fade-in animations
- Empty-state illustrations for no-data views
- Loading spinner overlay on form submission
- Django messages framework wired to Bootstrap alert styles
